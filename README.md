#object detection and collision warning

Unfortunately I wasnt able to uplad my tensorflow object detection folder but i will be able to guide you the instruction from here
You can find the tensorflow object detection files in the appendix, zipped.
The files on here are also in the zipped folder. So there is no need to copy the object detection files from here.
I have only uploaded them here to show my contribution to the project.

You can look at the tensorflow github page i have linked above for its dependencies.
Then follow the tutorial i followed which is linked up there just to install the api and other dependencies. 
because the changes he makes to the files would have been already done by me. 
All you have to do is install the api and the test your object detector on the object_detection_tutorial.ipynb
if all is good, then you can simply run the object_detection_image.py file or object_detection_video.py file to see an output,
if you want to run the object_detection_webcam.py file, follow the tutorial linked above



#lane detectiion
The files in edge detection folder can perfom the edge detection.
You can run the canny python file noramlly but change image file inside if you want to test other images

To run the holistic model keep the ile stucture the same as you would need the pre trained weights in hed_model folder. 
the method run this model is in the executable
